# Task Manager Console Application

## Purpose

This simple console application is designed as a testing ground for exploring and applying dependency injection principles. The primary goal is to demonstrate how various components can be decoupled and interchanged within the application to enhance flexibility and maintainability.

## Key Features

- Task creation and management
- Separation of input and output mechanisms
- Testing different implementations without altering core logic

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository.
2. Review the project's structure to understand the implementation of dependency injection.
3. Experiment with different implementations of input and output for hands-on testing.

## Feedback

Your feedback and insights are highly appreciated. Feel free to make suggestions or ask questions about the project's design and implementation.
